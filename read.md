In this project I utilized Leaftlet, Jquery, and Ajax. I utilized the CDC for the data that my map used. Some of the more important functions I used in this project were the mouseover and mouseout functions. This allowed me to provide some extra interactivity for my map and keep the user engaged. The legend was also an important component as it gave the reader some sense of scale and an ability to read the map properly. This map displays the amount of measles cases across the United States. Circle scaling was used to depict an increase in the amount of cases.
